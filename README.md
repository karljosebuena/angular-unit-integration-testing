# Angular Unit and Integration Testing
Learn to write unit and integration tests for your Angular apps and deploy them with confidence

# Description
As your application grows in complexity, the cost of manual testing increases exponentially. Adding a new feature or fixing a bug may break several other places in the application, and covering all those edge cases with manual testing ends up being extremely painful and nearly impossible. 



Automated testing is a practice that has been adopted by a lot of successful software development teams over the past decade. You simply write code to test your application, and then run those tests in an automated fashion. 



Initially, your development time increases a bit because you need to write extra code to test your production code. However, that is the cost that you pay only once. Once you have those tests in place, you can run several thousands of them in just a few seconds over and over. Compare that with the time required to manually test every bit of your application! 



With automated testing, you spend less time fixing bugs and doing manual repetitive tests every time you add a new feature or fix a bug. Instead, you can spend your time doing more fun things.
